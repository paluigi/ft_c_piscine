Hello, exhaulted visitor!

These are the files to the c programming execrises used for the 42 School C Piscine, which is a coding challange lasting about a month.
I was learning at the time, so I make no promise any of these work and have no plan to update them.

## If you are in the C Piscine at 42 or on any other campus, CODE THIS ON YOUR OWN!
Your skill as a coder will thank you.

## When picking solo vs team projects, always focus on team projects and communication.
Your skill as a human will thank you.
